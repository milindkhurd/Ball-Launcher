	ring setup tone
	set startup timer
	read previous setting from EROM
	move spinner to top position
	move spinner to preset position
	set the ball feed rate, ball spin speed, horizontal position, vertical position 
	
	
give pause of 2 - timetaken till here secs before starting
stop setup tone

beer to indicate game start

Everytime when 0 position is passed check if other 2 sensor values are high - in case of any anamoly reset.

encoder sensor 0 1, when sensor 1 is high, loop for sensor 0 to be high, when both high count steps to move if = then stop else increment step and keep moving.
